# Lander-Rust

## What is this?

This is a selection of classes and APIs that allow the hard work of a Lander clone to be done in web assembly.

## How do I build it?

1. Make sure you have Rust installed
2. Make sure you have wasm-pack installed:
    - `$ cargo install wasm-pack`
3. Build it: 
    - `$ ./build.sh`

JavaScript linking file and wasm binary should be in the packages folder for you to use with your own JS in the browser.
